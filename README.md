# Automated-Plant-Health-Analysis-using-Parallel-Computing
his project focuses on **automated plant detection, counting, and health assessment** using **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index)**. By leveraging **parallel computing techniques (CUDA, OpenCL, OpenMP)**, the system significantly speeds up image processing for large datasets.

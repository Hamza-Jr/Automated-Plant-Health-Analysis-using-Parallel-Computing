## ** Introduction**  
This project aims to **automate plant health analysis** by processing **RGB and NIR (Near Infrared) images** to compute vegetation indices such as **NDVI** and **NDWI**. The key features include:  

 **Automated Plant Detection & Counting** â€“ No manual field inspection required.  
 **Parallelized Processing** â€“ CUDA, OpenCL, and OpenMP accelerate image analysis.  
 **Precision Health Monitoring** â€“ NDVI/NDWI values indicate plant health.  
 **Interactive Visualization** â€“ Color-coded field representation for insights.

## ** Dataset**  
The dataset consists of **306 RGB and NIR images** of an agricultural field with a resolution of **1296Ã—966 pixels**.  
Each image is processed to extract plant-specific health data.

### **2. NDVI and NDWI Computation Examples**  

#### **2.1 NDVI Image (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)**  
This image highlights areas of active vegetation. The colors represent different vitality levels:  
- **Dark Green**: Healthy plants (**NDVI â‰¥ 0.6**)  
- **Light Green**: Moderate vegetation (**0.3 â‰¤ NDVI < 0.6**)  
- **Orange**: Stressed plants (**0 â‰¤ NDVI < 0.3**)  
- **Red**: Unhealthy vegetation or absent plants (**NDVI < 0**)

### **3. Output Images**  
Each detected plant is highlighted with a **green bounding box**.  
- **NDVI and NDWI values** are displayed for each plant.  
- Plants are **color-coded based on their health status**, making visualization easier.

## **4. Performance Comparison**  

To evaluate the efficiency of different optimization approaches (**OpenCL, OpenMP, CUDA**) compared to the sequential implementation, we used a dataset of **306 images**.  
Each configuration was executed **10 times**, and the **average processing time per image** was measured for performance comparison.
